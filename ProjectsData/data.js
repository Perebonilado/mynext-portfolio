        description: `This project was a no brainer for me. I have a high penchant for music and the first thing I wanted to build was a music player.
        I really want to combine my years of experience in the music industry with tech. I believe there are many opportunities, especially with the advent of web3. A musician knows a musicians problems, as such,
        I believe, slowly but surely, I will make an impact in the music industry using tech. I built this using vanilla CSS and JavaScript, utilizing core programming concepts as well as ensuring clean code.`,

        A ticket might be an issue that needs resolving, as such, with the use of the chat feature, users can communicate with each other based on a ticket raised and track the status of that ticket. The ticket ID is entered and the issue can be resolved using 
        this web application. This web app was built using React js. I utilized the context api, react hooks such as useState and useEffect to build this project. The design was implemented using vanilla CSS as it was translated from an Adobe XD file by me. I built this product for Crown Interactive LTD, a software company based in Lagos, Nigeria.`,

        description: `I graduated from the department of Zoology in the University of Ibadan. While studying, we would go to the field to carry out water
        quality analysis using macro invertebrates. After collecting the macro invertebrates, someone would start a timer and another peroson would have a text book handy for idetifying specimens. It was tedious.
        As such, I built this application which has an in-built timer, computer generated vocals to update users on how much time they have left and when the time is up. Also, it has an in-built key for identifying organisms.
        Moreover, after collecting and identifying organisms, we would have to then check their indexes and calculate the water quality. This process was prone to errors. As such, this application is programmed to check and match the index of the
        organism inputed, calculate the water index automatically and tell the user how polluted the water body is, saving time, increasing the quality of data and reducing errors.`,
