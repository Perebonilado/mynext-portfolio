        popular social media app, Instagram. Authentication is handled
        by google oAuth, allowing you to create an account using google
        as well as sign in and sign out. The upload feature is fully functional as well, however,
        limited to images to save space. You may search for other users as well as follow and interact with their
        posts by liking and commenting on them as those features are fully functional.
        I enjoyed working on this project as it was fun to build a social media app you can use to interact with others.
        The data base was built using the serverless firebase database.`,

        There is a dedicated page for each blog post, as well as pagination to limit the number of blog posts per page. I also used TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript to build this
        in React Js. Furthermore, there is a search bar which filters through the blog posts and renders the relevant results to the screen. I intend to keep improving on this by adding authentication and api end points
        to allow people sign up and post their own blogs.`,

        I utilized an API to fetch data on current crypto prices. I engineered this using Vanilla Js and Vanilla CSS. It is fully responsive and renders crypto data in real time. This

            I really want to combine my years of experience in the music industry with tech. I believe there are many opportunities, especially with the advent of web3. A musician knows a musicians problems, as such,
            I believe, slowly but surely, I will make an impact in the music industry using tech. I built this using vanilla CSS and JavaScript, utilizing core programming concepts as well as ensuring clean code.`,
