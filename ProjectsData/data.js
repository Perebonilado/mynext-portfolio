        There is a dedicated page for each blog post, as well as pagination to limit the number of blog posts per page. I also used TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript to build this
        in React Js. Furthermore, there is a search bar which filters through the blog posts and renders the relevant results to the screen. I intend to keep improving on this by adding authentication and api end points
        to allow people sign up and post their own blogs.`,

        I utilized an API to fetch data on current crypto prices. I engineered this using Vanilla Js and Vanilla CSS. It is fully responsive and renders crypto data in real time. This 
        application allows users to carry out pair to pair trading of crypto currencies.`,

            I really want to combine my years of experience in the music industry with tech. I believe there are many opportunities, especially with the advent of web3. A musician knows a musicians problems, as such,
            I believe, slowly but surely, I will make an impact in the music industry using tech. I built this using vanilla CSS and JavaScript, utilizing core programming concepts as well as ensuring clean code.`,

        description: `I graduated from the department of Zoology in the University of Ibadan. While studying, we would go to the field to carry out water
        quality analysis using macro invertebrates. After collecting the macro invertebrates, someone would start a timer and another peroson would have a text book handy for idetifying specimens. It was tedious.
        As such, I built this application which has an in-built timer, computer generated vocals to update users on how much time they have left and when the time is up. Also, it has an in-built key for identifying organisms.
        Moreover, after collecting and identifying organisms, we would have to then check their indexes and calculate the water quality. This process was prone to errors. As such, this application is programmed to check and match the index of the
        organism inputed, calculate the water SIGNAL automatically and tell the user how polluted the water body is, saving time, increasing the quality of data and reducing errors.`,
